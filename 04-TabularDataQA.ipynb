The prompt tells the LLM to break down the process of answering a complex query into a sequence of steps that are resolved one at a time.\n",

        "Agents become really cool when we combine them with â€˜expertsâ€™, introduced in the MRKL paper. Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself. This is actually the concept behind [ChatGPT Pluggins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n",

        "In our case, in order to solve the problem \"How do I ask questions to a tabular CSV file\", we need this REACT/MRKL approach, in which we need to instruct the LLM that it needs to use an 'expert/tool' in order to read/load/understand/interact with a CSV tabular file.\n",
